food and good timesWelcome to London Time Travel London is immersed in history with more than its share of mindblowing antiquity Londons buildings are eyecatching milestones in the citys unique and compelling biography and a great many of them  the Tower of London Westminster Abbey Big Ben  are instantly familiar landmarks Theres more than enough innovation the Shard the London Eye the planned Garden Bridge to put a crackle in the air but it never drowns out Londons wellpreserved centuriesold narrative Architectural grandeur rises all around you in the West End ancient remains dot the City and charming pubs punctuate the banks of the Thames Take your pick Art  Culture A tireless innovator of art and culture London is a city of ideas and the imagination Londoners have always been fiercely independent thinkers and critics but until not so long ago people were suspicious of anything they considered avantgarde Thats all in the past now and the citys creative milieu is streaked with leftfield attitude from theatrical innovation to contemporary art pioneering music writing and design Food in all its permutations has become almost an obsession in certain circlesEthnic Diversity This city is very multicultural with a third of all Londoners foreign born representing 270 different nationalities What unites them and visitors alike is the English language for this is both our tongues birthplace and its epicentre These cultures season the culinary aromas on Londons streets the often exotic clothing people wear and the music they listen to Londons diverse cultural dynamism makes it among the worlds most international cities And diversity reaches intrinsically British institutions too the British and Victoria  Albert Museums have collections as varied as they are magnificent while flavours at centuriesold Borough Market now run the full gourmet and cosmopolitan spectrum A Tale of Two Cities London is as much about wideopen spaces and leafy escapes as it is highdensity sightpacked exploration Central London is where you will find the major museums galleries and most iconic sights but visit Hampstead Heath or the new Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park to escape the crowds and view the citys greener hues up close Or venture even further out to Kew Gardens Richmond or Hampton Court Palace for excellent panoramas of riverside LondonLAURIE NOBLE  GETTY IMAGES

Fashion is big in London but very eclectic so youre unlikely to stand out whatever your sartorial choice Dress codes are rare although youll need smart shoes for some restaurants and clubs but many Londoners make an effort in the evening whether theyre kitted out in cool T shirts or more formal gear The weather has a mind of its own regardless of the season always carry an umbrella or a jacket

everything shuts down including the transport network Hotel restaurants are about the only thing youll find open  Most shops in central London are open seven days a week though they can only trade for six hours usually noon to 6pm on Sunday  London is a relatively safe city though common sense applies avoid deserted streets at night and be mindful of pickpockets in crowded areas or even at outdoor

fly to the moon If youre a tourist in need of directions theres no problem But try starting a general conversation at a bus stop or on a tube platform and people will react as if you were mad  QueuesThe English are happy to break many rules they consider silly but lining up is not one of them Any attempt to jump the queue will result in an outburst of tutting  TubeAn unbreakable rule

Around For more information see Transport p38022 Publications Pty LtdTravel Etiquette  Have your ticket or card ready before you go through the gate Londoners are wellpracticed at moving through ticket barriers without breaking stride  On escalators stand on the righthand side and use the left if you want to walk down Failure to observe this can cause consternation among other users especially during rush hour  Take your rucksack off at rush hour to avoid sweeping off somebodys newspaper tablet or child  Give up your seat for people less able to stand than you  people with reduced mobility have priority over the seats closest to the doors on the tube  Cars will usually stop for pedestrians at zebra crossings without a traffic light remember to look right first howeverTickets  Passes  The cheapest and most convenient way to pay for public transport is to buy an Oyster Card a smart card on which you can store credit The card works on the entire transport network and can be purchased from all tube and train stations and some shops  Oyster Cards will work out whether to charge you per journey for a return or for a day travelcard  You need to pay a 5 deposit per Oyster Card which you will get back when you return the card along with any remaining credit  If youre staying for more than just a few days consider getting a weekly or monthly pass which can be loaded on the Oyster card  Paper tickets are still available but are more expensive than Oyster fares  Contactless cards can be used instead of Oyster Cards they benefit from the same smart fare system just check for international fees with your card issuer For much more on getting aroundsee p382When to Travel  Travelling during rush hour 630am to 930am and 4pm to 7pm can be uncomfortably crowded think stealthy seat races faceinarmpit standing and toetreading Tube fares are also more expensive at rush hour and tempers easily fray  Weekends are notorious for engineering works when entire tube lines or sections of lines shut down Replacement bus services are usually in place but they often take longer so try to plan around these restrictions  On weeknights the tube stops running around 1230am selected lines run all night Friday and Saturday night Night buses cover all corners of London but note that some services only run every halfhour so check times before leaving lest you fancy hanging around at a bus stop at 3amTOP TIPS  As a general rule eschew the tube within Zone 1 unless going from one end to the other cycling walking or the bus will be cheaperquicker  Check wwwtflgov uk or advanced notices intube stations for planned engineering works and line closures at weekends  Get an Oyster Card  and return it when you leave to get the 5 deposit back along with any remaining credit Santander Cycles are good for short trips  you pay 2 for the day and can cycle for up to 30 minutes for free as many times as you like Just leave five

 waiting until lateopening nights before slipping into museums or galleries swarming to parks as soon as the sun pops out  so go where they go and be surprisedDrinking Like a Local Londoners and the British in general get bad press for binge drinking But most drinking in London is actually warmly sociable gregarious and harmless fun Londoners drink at the local shorthand for the pub around the corner Prices may be high but generosity is commonplace and drinkers always step up to buy the next round Despite the fickle weather alfresco drinking is commonplace be it in beer gardens or on patios or pavements Dining Like a Local As a rule of thumb Londoners will dine at their local fish and chip shop or enjoy Sunday roast at their local gastropub rather than trek across town for dinner but theyll readily go out for a meal further afield for special occasions Youll also find them piling on the periperi sauce at Nandos enjoying a fryup full English breakfast at a greasy spoon a nofrills cafe or grabbing a sandwich from Marks  Spencer to lunch outside in Hyde Park Food markets are incredibly popular be they the gourmet likes of Borough Market p162 or smaller farmers markets across town Idiosyncratic delicacies youll find Londoners tucking into include chip butty fries in a sandwich marmite a yeast extract spread on toast and jellied eel often served with pies Shopping Like a

London has some of the worlds most beautiful urban green spaces and locals swarm en masse to the park the minute the sun pops out to read a book play football lord over a picnic or BBQ or just chat with friends on the grass Join them at lunch time when office workers come out for their fix of sunlight or at weekends for fun and games Sightseeing Like a Local Londoners are habitually off the

what you find Many Londoners bide their time until latenight openings for central London museums when there are less crowds and save regular hour visits for special exhibitions Local Obsessions Property Owning a property is a national obsession in the UK but is made particularly difficult in London where prices are stratospheric Talks of unaffordable housing renting versus buying mortgage deals putting an offer and being gazumped DIY and grand renovations are classic Sunday lunch fodder North v South The existential divide between Norff and Saff of the river remains as wide as ever Each camp swears by its side For Londoners the main difference is that South London lacks access to the tube which means that house prices are lower But for visitors the debate is moot London is

years and is today an undisputed dining destination There are plenty of topnotch Michelinstarred restaurants but it is the sheer diversity on offer that is headspinning from Afghan to Vietnamese London is a virtual A to Z of world cuisineEatingFull English breakfast CHIEN HAN CHEE  EYEEM  GETTY IMAGES   Publications Pty Ltd44Specialities ENGLISH FOOD England might have given the world baked beans on toast mushy peas and chip butties French fries between two slices of buttered and untoasted white bread but thats hardly the whole story When well prepared  be it a Sunday lunch of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding light batter baked until fluffy eaten with gravy or a cornet of lightly battered fish and chips sprinkled with salt and malt vinegar  English food can be excellent And nothing beats a fryup or full English breakfast with bacon sausages beans eggs and mushrooms the morning after a big night out Modern British food has become a cuisine in its own right by championing traditional and sometimes underrated ingredients such as root vegetables smoked fish shellfish game sausages and black pudding a kind of sausage stuffed with oatmeal spices and blood Dishes can be anything from game served with a traditional vegetable such as Jerusalem artichoke to seared scallops with orangescented black pudding or roast pork with chorizo on rosemary mash SEAFOOD Many visitors to England comment that for islanders Brits seem to make surprisingly little of their seafood with the exception of the ubiquitous  and institutionalised  fish and chips But modern British restaurants have started to cast their nets and many offer local specialities such as Dover sole Cornish oysters Scottish scallops smoked NEED TO KNOW Opening Hours As a rule most restaurants serve lunch between noon and 230pm and dinner between 6pm and 11pm Brasserietype establishments and chains tend to have continuous service from noon to 11pm Price Ranges These symbols indicate the average cost per main course at the restaurant in question less than 10 1020 more than 20 Reservations  Make reservations for weekends if youre keen on a particular place or if youre in a group of more than four people  Topend restaurants often run multiple sittings with allocated time slots generally two hours pick a late slot if you dont want to be rushed Tipping Most restaurants automatically tack a discretionary service charge usually 125 onto the bill this should be clearly advertised If you feel the service wasnt adequate you can tip separately or not tip at all If there is no service charge on your bill

from different parts of Asia Middle Eastern cuisine is also well covered Food from continental Europe  French Italian Spanish Greek Scandinavian  is another favourite with many excellent modern

GGastropubs While not so long ago the pub was where you went for a drink with maybe a packet of potato crisps to soak up the alcohol the birth of the gastropub in the 1990s means that today just about every establishment serves full meals But the quality varies widely from defrostedonthepremises to Michelinstar worthy Breakfast The Brits were always big on breakfast  they even invented one the full English breakfast Its something of a protein overload but theres nothing quite like it to mop up the excesses of a night on the tiles A typical plate will include bacon sausages baked beans in tomato sauce eggs fried or scrambled mushrooms tomatoes and toast maybe with Marmite Youll find countless brightlylit grotty cafes  nicknamed greasy spoons  serving these monster plates Theyre also a must in gastropubs Making a comeback on the breakfast table is porridge boiled oats in water or milk served hot sweet or savoury Topend restaurants serving breakfast such as Balthazar p117 have played a big part in glamming up what was essentially poor folks food Its great with banana and honey fruit compote or even plain with some chocolate powder Vegetarians  Vegans London has been one of the best places for vegetarians to dine out since the 1970s initially due mostly to its many Indian restaurants which for religious reasons always cater for people who dont eat meat A number of dedicated vegetarian restaurants have since cropped up offering imaginative filling and truly delicious meals Most nonvegetarian places generally offer a couple of dishes for those who dont eat meat vegans however will find it harder outside Indian or dedicated establishments Celebrity Chefs Londons food renaissance was partly led by a group of telegenic chefs who built food empires around their names and their TV programs Gordon Ramsay is the most in famous of the lot but his London venues are still standardbearers for topquality cuisine Other big names include Jamie Oliver whose restaurant

at the heart of London life and is one of the capitals great social levellers Virtually every Londoner has a local and looking for your own is a fun part of any visit to the capital Pubs in central London are mostly afterwork drinking dens busy from 5pm onwards with the postwork crowd during the week and revellers at weekends But in more residential areas pubs come into their own at weekends when long lunches turn into sloshy afternoons and groups of friends settle in for the night Many also run popular quizzes on weeknights Other pubs entice punters through the doors with live music or comedy Some have developed such a reputation for the quality of their food that theyve been dubbed gastropubs  Youll be able to order almost anything you like in a pub from beer to wine soft drinks spirits and sometimes hot drinks too Some specialise in craft beer offering drinks from local microbreweries including real ale fruit beers organic ciders and other rarer beverages Others particularly the gastropubs have invested in a good wine list In winter some pubs offer mulled wine in summer the musthave drink is Pimms and lemonade if its properly done it should have fresh mint leaves citrus strawberries and cucumber BEER The raison detre of a pub is first and foremost to serve beer  be it lager ale or stout ina glass or a bottle On draught drawn from the cask it is served by the pint 570mL or halfpint 285mL and more occasionally thirdofapint for real ale tasting Pubs generally serve a good selection of lager highly carbonated and drunk cool or cold and a smaller selection of real ales or bitter still or only slightly gassy drunk at room temperature with strong flavours The bestknown British lager brand is Carling although youll find everything from Fosters to San Miguel Among the multitude of ales on offer in London pubs London Pride Courage Best Burton Ale Adnams Theakston in particular Old Peculiar and Old Speckled Hen are among the best Once considered something of an old mans drink real ale is enjoying a renaissance among young Londoners Staff at bars serving good selections of real ales and craft beers smallbatch beers from independent brewers are often hugely knowledgeable just like a sommelier in a restaurant with a good cellar so ask them for recommendations if youre not sure what to order Stout the best known of which is Irish Guinness is a slightly sweet dark beer with a distinct flavour that comes from malt that is roasted before fermentation Numerous microbreweries have sprouted throughout London in recent years Names to look out for include Meantime Sambrooks Camden Town Brewery London Fields Brewery the Five Points Brewing Co Redchurch Beavertown Crate Brewery Hackney BrewYou need only glance at William Hogarths Gin Lane prints from

everything in betweenDrinking  Nightlife Publications Pty Ltd52ery Pressure Drop Anspach  Hobday Partizan the Kernel and Brew by Numbers Bars In the large party space left between pubs and clubs bars are a popular alternative for a London night out Generally staying open later than pubs but closing earlier than clubs they tempt those keen to skip bedtime at 11pm but not keen enough to pay a hefty cover charge and stay out all night Many have DJs on weekends and sometimes a small dance floor too Drinks tend to be more expensive than pub prices and some dance bars charge a small cover charge later in the night Cocktail bars are undergoing a renaissance so youll find lots of upmarket options serving increasingly interesting concoctions Specialist wine whisky craft beer and cider bars have also been sprouting in profusion A romantic attachment to the US prohibition era has seen a scattering of speakeasies hiding themselves in basements and down back lanes Clubs When it comes to clubbing London is up there with the best of them Youll probably know what you want to experience  it might be big clubs such as Fabric p207 or the Ministry of Sound p284 or sweaty shoebox clubs with the freshest DJ talent  but theres plenty to tempt you to branch out from your usual tastes and try something new Whether thumping techno indie rock Latin ska pop dubstep grimeminimal electro RB or hip hop theres something going on every night Thursdays are loved by those who want to have their fun before the office workers mob the streets on Friday Saturdays are the busiest and best if youre a serious clubber and Sundays often see surprisingly good events throughout London popular with hospitality workers who tradionally have Mondays off There are clubs across town though it has to be said that the best of them are moving further out of the centre by the NEED TO KNOW Opening Hours Traditionally pubs opened at 11am or midday and closed at 11pm with a slightly earlier closing on a Sunday A 2005 law change enabled longer opening hours and although most still close at around midnight some bars and pubs remain open to around 2am or 3am Clubs generally open at 10pm and close between 3am and 7am Club Costs Many clubs are free or cheaper midweek If you want to go to a famous club on a Saturday night thenight for clubbing expect to pay around 20 Some places are considerably cheaper if you arrive earlier in the night Tickets  Guest Lists Queuing in the cold at 11pm can be frustrating get there early andor book tickets for bigger events if you cant bear being left in limbo Some clubs allow you to sign up on their guest list beforehand check ahead on their websites Dress Code Londons clubs are generally relaxed Posh clubs in areas such as Kensington will want a glam look so dress

hire company Y oull also find that although easy to ride the bikes only have three gears and are quite heavy Y ou must be 18 to buy access and at least 14 to ride a bike Hiring a Bike  Insert your debit or credit card in the docking station to pay your access fee only once for the access period  Request a cycle release code slip at the docking station every time you want to take a bike during your access period  Enter the release code at your chosen bike dock wait for the green light to release the bike  If you find it difficult to pull the bike free from its dock bounce the back wheel up and down first  Ride  Return the bike at any free dock wait for the green light to make sure the bike is locked  If the docking station is full consult the terminal to find available docking points

the big museums the British Museum and the National Gallery and at least a couple of hours for places like Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace One of the delights of the West End is its energy and there is no better way to enjoy it than by walking around and taking it all in Atmospheric places for a breather include Covent Garden Trafalgar Sq and St Jamess Park Westminster and Whitehall are deserted in the evenings with little in the way of bars and restaurants Its a similar story in St Jamess Instead head to vibrant Soho for fantastic bars and restaurants or the streets surrounding

pastureland that belonged to a convent associated with Westminster Abbey in the 13th century The site became the property of John Russell the first Earl of Bedford in 1552 His descendants employed the architect Inigo Jones to convert a vegetable field into a square in the 17th century He built the elegant Italianstyle piazza and its tall terraced houses soon started to draw rich socialites who coveted the central living quarters The bustling fruit and veg market  immortalised inMy Fair Ladywhere it was a flower market  dominated the piazza London society including such writers as Pepys

the spot where Londons Transport Museum now stands During the 1970s the city traffic made it increasingly difficult to maintain the fruit and veg market so it was moved to Nine Elms in South London in

famously it has been a a prison and site of execution Tower Green The buildings to the west and the south of this verdant patch have always accommodated Tower officials Indeed the current constable has a flat in Queens House built in 1540 But what looks at first glance like a peaceful almost villagelike slice of the Towers inner ward is actually one of its bloodiest Scafold Site Those lucky

Built in stone as a fortress in 1078 this was the original Tower of London  its name arose after Henry III whitewashed it in the 13th century Standing just 30m high its not exactly a skyscraper by modern standards but in the the Middle Ages it would have dwarfed the wooded huts surrounding the castle walls and intimidated the peasantry Apart from St Johns Chapel most of its interior is given

at present  and in order to qualify for the job they must have served a minimum of 22 years in any branch of the British Armed Forces They all live within the Tower walls and are known affectionately as Beefeaters a nickname they dislike The origin of this name is unknown although its thought to be due to the rations of beef  then a luxury food  given to them in the past There is currently just one female Yeoman Warder Moira Cameron who in 2007 became the first woman to be given the post While officially they guard the Tower and Crown Jewels at night their main role is as tour guides and to

fickle London skies and roar of passing aircraft leaving the 700 groundlings to stand in Londons notorious downpours Despite the worldwide popularity of Shakespeare over the centuries the Globe was almost a distant memory when American actor and later film director Sam Wanamaker came searching for it in 1949 Undeterred by the fact that the theatres foundations had vanished beneath a row of heritagelisted Georgian houses Wanamaker set up the Globe Playhouse Trust in 1970 and began fundraising for a memorial theatre Work started only 200m from the original Globe site in 1987 but Wanamaker died four years before it opened in 1997 The Globe also opened the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in 2014 an indoor Jacobean theatre Shakespeare wrote for both outdoor and indoor theatre and the playhouse

This whole area was originally part of the medieval St Johns Priory and is now associated with the revived Order of St John The walled garden planted with medicinal herbs and flowers was built as a memorial to St Johns workers who died during the world wars If the somewhat boxy streetlevel church doesnt seem like it ever belonged to a medieval priory thats because it didnt The real treasure lies beneath where the nave of the original church has been preserved as a darkened crypt Built in the 1380s in the Norman Romanesque style its one of the oldest buildings in London Inside theres a sturdy alabaster effigy of a Castilian knight 1575 and a battered monument portraying the last prior Sir William Weston as a decaying body in a shroud a memento mori designed to remind viewers of their own mortality The nave once abutted a large circular chancel that was demolished following the dissolution of the priory Outside the outline of the original church has been traced onto the square

mainly in isolation in their cells and take vows of silence broken only for three hours on Sundays In 1537 the monastery was dissolved and the property transferred to King Henry VIII The prior and 15 of the monks were executed  some were hung drawn and quartered at Tyburn near Marble Arch and the rest sent to Newgate Gaol where they were chained upright and died of starvation They were the first of Englands Catholic martyrs of the Reformation and three of them were subsequently canonised The king sold the property in 1545 to Sir Edward North who converted it into his London mansion knocking down the original church and much of the cloister in the process In 1611 it was purchased by Thomas Sutton known at the time as the richest commoner in England In his will Sutton directed that it should become a school for boys and an almshouse for destitute gentlemen Around 40 pensioners known as brothers still live here today and one of their number leads the tours Charterhouse School moved to Surrey in 1872 and is still going strong Famous people associated with Charterhouse include Elizabeth I and James I both of whom came here prior to their coronations William Makepeace Thackeray

church bells ofSt MaryleBow p148 on Cheapside Since few people actually live in the City this definition has broadened to take in those living further east The term cockney is often used to describe anyone speaking what is also called estuarine English in which t and h are routinely dropped and glottal stops  what the two ts sound like in bottle  abound In fact the true cockney language also uses something called rhyming slang which may have developed among Londons costermongers street traders as a code to avoid police attention This code replaced common nouns and verbs with rhyming phrases So going up the apples and pears meant going up the stairs the trouble and strife was the wife telling porky pies was telling lies and would you Adam and Eve it was would you believe it Over time the second of the two words tended to be dropped so the rhyme vanished Few if any people still use pure cockney but a good many still understand it Youre more likely to come across it in residual phrases such as telling porkies lying use your loaf loaf of bread for head ooh me plates of meat feet or es me best china china plate for mate223East London E ATN5Hackney GREEN PAPAYA VETNAMESE Mapp430

native Iceni tribe led by the famous Queen Boudica Boudicea Folk legend places the queens final resting place beneath platform nine The name Kings Cross derives from a monstrously tall statue of King George IV erected in 1840 The king wasnt particularly popular and the monument only survived until 1845 The surrounding St Pancras parish takes the name of a 14yearold Roman boy martyred under the Emperor Diocletian Its thought that some of his remains were brought here in the 6th century and installed in a church where St Pancras Old Church now stands Some historians think there may have been

to become increasingly dependent on the barricade Completed three decades ago the barrier consists of 10 movable gates anchored to nine concrete piers each as tall as a fivestorey building The silver roofs on the piers house the operating machinery that rotates the gates against excess water Tested monthly they make a glitteringly surreal sight straddling the river in the lee of a giant warehouse The Thames is a tidal river with its tide rising and falling twice a day  a difference in levels of up to 8m  and once a fortnight theres also a stronger spring tide The danger comes when the spring tide coincides with an unexpected surge which pushes tonnes of extra water upriver The barrier has been built to prevent that water pouring over the riverbanks and flooding nearby houses Environmentalists are already talking about a bigger wider damming mechanism further towards the mouth of the river on the North Sea before the current barrier comes to the expected end of its design life in about 2035 The barrier looks best when raised and the only guaranteed time this happens is when the mechanisms are checked once a month For exact dates and times check with the Thames Barrier

Roman Empire in Britain began to decline with increasing attacks by the Picts and Scotti in the north and the Saxons Germanic tribes originating from north of the Rhine in the southeast In 410 when the embattled Emperor Honorius refused them military aid the Romans abandoned Britain and Londinium was reduced to a sparsely populated backwater Lundenwic What happened to Londinium after the Roman withdrawal is still the subject of much historical debate While there is no written record whatsoever of the town from 457 to 604 most historians now think that RomanoBritons continued to live here even as Saxon settlers established farmsteads and small villages in the area Lundenwic or London settlement was established outside the city walls due west of Londinium and around presentday Aldwych and Charing Cross as a Saxon trade settlement By the early 7th century the Saxons had been converted to Christianity by the popes emissary Augustine Lundenwic was an episcopate and the first St Pauls Cathedral was established at the top of Ludgate Hill This infant trading community grew in importance and attracted the attention of the Vikings in Denmark They attacked in 842 and again nine years later burning Lundenwic to the ground Under the leadership of King Alfred the Great of Wessex the Saxon population fought back driving the Danes out in 886 Saxon London grew into a prosperous and

for the Saxon kings Harold Godwinson the Earl of Wessex was anointed successor by Edward on his deathbed but this enraged William the Duke of Normandy who claimed that Edward had promised him the throne William mounted a massive invasion of England from France and on 14 October defeated Harold at the Battle of Hastings before marching on London to claim his prize William now dubbed the Conqueror was crowned king of England in the new Westminster Abbey on 25 December 1066 ensuring the Norman conquest was complete William distrusted the vast and fierce populace of London and to intimidate his new subjects as well as protect himself from them he built 10 castles within a days march of London including the White Tower the core of the Tower of London Cleverly he kept the prosperous merchants on side by confirming the citys independence in exchange for taxes London soon became the principal town of England Medieval London The last of the Norman kings Stephen died in 1154 and the throne passed to Henry II of the powerful House of Plantagenet which would rule England for the next two and a half centuries Henrys successors were happy to let the City of London keep its independence as long as its merchants continued to finance their wars and building projects When Richard I known as the Lionheart a king who spent a mere six months of his life in England needed funds for his crusade to the Holy Land he recognised the city as a selfgoverning commune in return for cash A city built on trade and commerce London would always guard its independence fiercely as Richards successor King John learned the hard way In 1215 John was forced to cede to the powerful barons and to curb his arbitrary demands for payoffs from the city Among those pressing him to put his

violence became a way of life and rioting was commonplace In 1381 miscalculating  or just disregarding  the mood of the nation the young Richard II tried to impose a poll tax on everyone in the realm Tens of thousands of peasants led by the soldier Wat Tyler and the prelates Jack Straw and John Ball marched in protest on London The Archbishop of Canterbury Simon Sudbury was dragged from the tower and beheaded several ministers were murdered and many buildings were razed before the Peasants Revolt ran its course and its leaders were executed London gained wealth and stature under the Houses of Lancaster and York in the 15th century but the two houses struggle for ascendancy led to the catastrophic Wars of the Roses The centurys greatest episode of political intrigue occurred during this

only a daughter after 24 years of marriage Turning his back on Rome he made himself the supreme head of the church in England and married Anne Boleyn the second of his six wives He dissolved abolished Londons monasteries seized the churchs vast wealth and property and smashed ecclesiastical culture Many of the religious houses disappeared leaving only their names in such areas as Whitefriars and Blackfriars after the colour of the robes worn by Carmelite and Dominican monks Despite his penchant for settling differences with the axe two of his six wives and Wolseys replacement as lord

popular monarch until his death in 1547 The reign of Mary I his daughter by Catherine of Aragon saw a brief return to Catholicism during which the queen sanctioned the burning to death of 200 Protestants at Smithfield and earned herself the nickname Bloody Mary By the time Elizabeth I Henry VIIIs daughter by Anne Boleyn took the throne Catholicism was a waning force and hundreds of people who dared to suggest otherwise were carted off to the gallows at Tyburn near todays Marble Arch Elizabethan London The 45year reign 15581603 of Elizabeth I is still looked upon as a golden age of English history and it was just as significant for London During these four decades English literature reached new and still unbeaten heights and religious tolerance gradually became accepted doctrine

much to begin with  the mayor himself dismissed it as something a woman might pisse out before going back to bed  but the unusual autumn heat combined with rising winds meant the fire raged out of control for four days reducing some 80 of London to ash Only eight people died officially at least but most of medieval London was obliterated The fire finally stopped at Pye Corner in Smithfield on the very edge of London not before destroying 88 churches including St Pauls Cathedral and more than 13000 houses leaving tens of thousands of people homeless Wrens London The inferno created a blank canvas upon which master architect Christopher Wren could build his 51 magnificent new churches and cathedral Wrens plan for rebuilding the entire city  much of it on a grid pattern  was deemed too expensive and many landlords opposed it the familiar pattern of streets that had grown up over the centuries since the time of the Romans quickly reappeared However new laws stipulated that brick and stone designs replace the old timberframed overhanging Tudor houses and that many roads be widened The fire accelerated the movement of the wealthy away from the City and into what is now the West End

was repelled by a mob of around half a million at the famous Battle of Cable St WWII  the Blitz Prime Minister Neville Chamberlains policy of appeasing Adolf Hitler during the 1930s eventually proved misguided as the Fuhrers lust for expansion appeared insatiable When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 Britain declared war having signed a mutualassistance pact with that nation a few days before WWII had begun The first year of the war was one of anxious waiting for London Some 600000 women and children had been evacuated to the countryside and the Battle of Britain raged elsewhere primarily around Royal Air Force bases in England but no bombs fell to disturb the blackout in the capital On 7 September 1940 that all came to a devastating end when the German Air Force the Luftwaffe dropped hundreds of bombs on the East End killing 430 people The Blitz from the German blitzkriegor lightning war lasted for 57 nights and then continued intermittently until midMay 1941 Some Underground stations were turned into giant bomb shelters although one bomb rolled down the escalator at Bank station and exploded on the platform killing more than 100 people Londoners responded with resilience and stoicism To the great admiration and respect of the people the royal family refused to leave London during the bombing Buckingham Palace took a direct hit during a bombing raid early in the campaign famously prompting Queen Elizabeth the present monarchs late mother to pronounce that Now I can look the East End in the face Winston Churchill prime minister from 1940 orchestrated much of Britains war strategy from the subterranean Cabinet War Rooms at Whitehall and it was from here that he made his stirring wartime speeches Londons spirit was tested again in June 1944 when Germany launched pilotless V1 bombers known as doodlebugs over East London By the time Nazi Germany capitulated in May 1945 up to a third of the East End and the City of London had been flattened almost 30000 Londoners killed and a further 50000 seriously woundedThe night of 29 ecember 1940 has been called the Second Great Fire of London  when German bombers dropped more than 100000

E B LTPostwar London  the 60s Once the Victory in Europe VE celebrations had died down the nation began to confront the wars appalling toll and to rebuild The years of austerity had begun with rationing of essential items and the building of highrise residences on bomb sites in areas such as Pimlico and the East End to solve the chronic housing problem To help boost morale London hosted the 1948 Olympics dubbed the austerity Games and the Festival of Britain in 1951 The gloom returned quite literally on 6 December 1952 in the form of the Great Smog A lethal blend of fog smoke and pollution descended and some 4000 people died of respiratory disorders This prompted the Clean Air Act of 1956 which introduced zones to central London where only smokeless fuels could be burned The current queen Elizabeth II was crowned in 1953 following the death of her muchloved father King George VI the year before Rationing of most goods ended in 1954 14 years after it had begun Immigrants

been assimilated into the city Africans are well documented to have served in the Roman army but they first came to England in significant numbers as slaves in Elizabethan times and settled around St Giles in Soho The first truly large influx of foreigners was in the late 17th century when Huguenots French Protestant refugees fleeing religious persecution at home settled in Spitalfields and Soho Jews have arrived over the past four centuries their traditional areas have been the East End particularly Spitalfields and Whitechapel and northwest London WWII brought Poles Ukrainians and other Eastern Europeans to London and today the Poles are a longestablished community in Hammersmith and Shepherds Bush The single biggest wave of immigration came in the 1950s when facing a labour shortage the government allowed anyone born in a UK colony to have British citizenship This brought a huge black population from the Caribbean and a large Asian diaspora from India Bangladesh and Pakistan The black population settled in West London and South London while those from the subcontinent were concentrated in the East End A third of all Londoners are now foreignborn representing 270 different nationalities speaking 300 languages351 History PS T WA R L T H E 6 0 Snew immigrants werent always welcomed on the streets as was proved in the Notting Hill race riots of 1958 Some economic prosperity returned in the late 1950s and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan told Britons theyd never had it so good London became the place to be during the 1960s when the bottledup creative energy of the postwar era was spectacularly uncorked London found itself the epicentre of cool in fashion and music the streets were awash with colour and vitality the iconic Mini car 1959 became a British icon and the Jaguar Etype 1961 was launched to adoring crowds Social norms underwent a revolution the introduction of the contraceptive pill the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the popularisation of drugs such as marijuana and LSD through the hippy movement created an unprecedented permissive and liberal climate Popular music in the midtolate 1960s became increasingly linked with drug use political activism and a countercultural mindset The Beatles recording at Abbey Rd and the Rolling Stones performing free in front of half a million people in Hyde Park were seminal moments Carnaby St and the Kings Rd were the most fashionable places on earth and popculture figures from Twiggy and David Bailey to Marianne Faithfull and Christine Keeler became the icons of the new era The Punk Era London returned to the doldrums in the harsh economic climate of the 1970s The citys onceimportant docks never recovered from the loss of empire the changing needs of modern container ships and poor labour relations disappearing altogether between 1968 and 1981 Shipping moved 25 miles east to Tilbury and the Docklands declined to a point of decay until they were rediscovered by property developers a decade later In 1973 a bomb exploded at the Old Bailey the Central Criminal Court signalling the arrival on English soil of the Irish Republican Army IRA and its campaign for a united Ireland Post1960s music became more formulaic as glam rock ruled despite the blossoming of London legends Marc Bolan and David Bowie Economic stagnation cynicism and the superficial limits of disco and glam rock spawned a novel London aesthetic punk Largely white energetic abrasive and fast punk transformed popular music and fashion in one stroke as teenagers traded in denim bellbottoms for black drainpipes and long hair for spiked Mohicans The late 1970s were exhilarating times for London youth as punk opened the door for new wave a punchy mod revival and the indulgent new romantics

leader Margaret Thatcher became the UKs first female prime minister In power for all of the 1980s and embarking on an unprecedented program of privatisation Margaret Thatcher  aka the Iron Lady  is arguably the most significant of Britains postwar leaders While her critics decry her approach to social justice and the large gulf that developed between the haves and have nots during her time in power her defenders point to the massive modernisation of Britains tradeuniondominated infrastructure and the vast wealth creation her policies generated In the beginning her monetarist policy sent unemployment skyrocketing an inquiry following the Brixton riots of 1981 found that an astonishing 55 of men aged under 19 in that part of London were jobless Meanwhile the Greater London Council GLC under the leadership of Red Ken Livingstone proved to be a thorn in Thatchers side County Hall which faces the Houses of Parliament across the Thames was hung with a giant banner recording the number of unemployed in the capital and goading the prime minister to do something about it Thatcher responded in 1986 by abolishing the GLC leaving London the only European capital without a unified central government While poorer Londoners suffered under Thatchers significant trimming back of the welfare state things had rarely looked better for the business community Riding a wave of confidence partly engendered by the deregulation of the stock exchange in 1986 the socalled Big Bang London underwent explosive economic growth Property developers proved to be only marginally more discriminating than the Luftwaffe though some outstanding modern structures including the Lloyds of London building went up Like previous booms the one of the late 1980s proved unsustainable As unemployment started to rise again and people found themselves living in houses worth much less than they had paid for them Thatcher introduced a flatrate poll tax Protests around the country culminated in a 1990 march on Trafalgar Sq that ended in a fully fledged riot Thatchers subsequent resignation after losing a confidence vote in Parliament brought to an end this divisive era in modern British history Her successor the former Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major employed a far more collective form of governmentThough it is now a few years old The Iron Lady 2011 starring Meryl Streep remains a very

government without the inspiring leadership of Thatcher The economy went into a tailspin shortly after and the IRA detonated two huge bombs one in the City in 1992 and another in the Docklands four years later The writing was on the wall for the Conservatives as the Labour Party reemerged with a new face Blairs Britain Desperate to return to power after almost two decades in opposition the Labour Party selected the telegenic Tony Blair to lead it The May 1997 general election overwhelmingly returned a Labour government to power but it was a much changed New Labour party one that had shed most of its socialist credo and supported a market economy privatisation and integration with Europe Most importantly for London Labour recognised the legitimate demand the city had for local government and created the London Assembly and the post of mayor Former leader of the GLC Ken Livingstone stood as an independent candidate and won easily Livingstone introduced a successful congestion charge to limit private vehicles in central London and sought to bring Londons backward public transport network into the 21st century Londons resurgence as a great world city seemed to be going from strength to strength culminating in its selection to host the Olympic Games in 2012 Londons buoyant mood was however shattered the very next morning when extremist Muslim terrorists detonated a series of bombs on the citys public transport network killing 52 people Triumph turned to terror followed quickly by anger and then defiance Just two weeks later the attempted detonation of several more bombs on Londons public transport system sent the city into a state of severe unease which culminated in the tragic shooting by the Metropolitan Police of an innocent Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes mistaken for one of the failed bombers Enter Boris Ken Livingstones campaign to get a third term as London mayor in 2008 was fatally undermined when the

within the walled Roman settlement of Londinium established in AD 43 on the northern banks of the River Thames on the site of todays City of London Few Roman traces survive outside museums though a Temple of Mithras built in AD 240 and excavated in 1954 will be relocated to the eastern end of Queen Victoria St in the City when the Bloomberg headquarters are completed at Walbrook Sq in 2016 Stretches of the Roman wall remain as foundations to a medieval wall outside Tower Hill tube station and in a few sections below Bastion Highwalk next to the Museum of London The Saxons who moved into the area after the decline of the Roman Empire found Londinium too small ignored what the Romans had left behind and built their communities further up the Thames Excavations carried out during renovations at the Royal Opera House in the late 1990s uncovered extensive traces of the Saxon settlement of Lundenwic including some houses of wattle and daub All HallowsbytheTower northwest of the Tower of London shelters an important archway the walls of a 7thcentury Saxon church and a Roman pavement St Brides Fleet St has a similar pavement With the arrival of William the Conqueror in 1066 the country received its first example of Norman architecture with the White Tower the sturdy keep at the heart of the Tower of London The church of St BartholomewtheGreat at Smithfield also has Norman arches and columns supporting its nave The west door and elaborately moulded porch at Temple Church shared by Inner and Middle Temple the undercroft at Westminster Abbey and the crypt at StMaryleBow are other outstanding examples of Norman architecture Medieval London Enlarged and refurbished in the 13th and 14th centuries by the builder king Henry III and his son Edward I or Longshanks Westminster Abbey is a splendid reminder of the work of master masons in the Middle Ages Perhaps the finest surviving medieval church in the city is the 13thcentury church of St

been methodically planned Rather it has developed in an organic read haphazard fashion London retains architectural reminders from every period of its long history but they are often hidden part of a

city for explorers Bear that in mind and youll make discoveries at virtually every turn356Circus dates from about 1250 Southwark Cathedral includes some remnants from the 12th and 13th centuries Secular medieval buildings are even more scarce although the ragstone Jewel Tower opposite the Houses of Parliament dates from 1365 and much of the Tower of London goes back to the Middle Ages Staple Inn in Holborn dates from 1378 but the halftimbered shopfront facade 1589 is mostly Elizabethan and heavily restored in the mid20th century Westminster Hall was originally built in 1199 the hammerbeam roof came 300 years later The great Medieval Hall 1479 at Eltham Palace also has a splendid hammerbeam roof A Trinity of Architects The finest London architect of the first half of the 17th century was Inigo Jones 15731652 who spent a year and a half in Italy and became a convert to the Renaissance architecture of Andrea Palladio Hischefs duvreinclude Banqueting House 1622 in Whitehall and Queens House 1635 in Greenwich Often overlooked is the much plainer church of St Pauls in Covent Garden which Jones designed in the 1630s The greatest architect to leave his mark on London was Christopher Wren 16321723 responsible for St Pauls Cathedral 1711 Wren oversaw the building or rebuilding of more than 50 churches many replacing medieval churches lost in the Great Fire as well as the Royal Hospital Chelsea 1692 and the Old Royal Naval College begun in 1694 at Greenwich His English baroque buildings and churches are taller and lighter than their medieval predecessors with graceful steeples taking the place of solid square medieval towers Nicholas Hawksmoor 16611736 was a pupil of Wren and worked with him on several churches before going on to design his own masterpieces The restored Christ Church 1729 in Spitalfields St Georges Bloomsbury 1731 St Annes Limehouse 1725 and St GeorgeintheEast 1726 at Wapping are among the finest of his halfdozen London churches Georgian Manners Among the greatest exponents of classicism or neoPalladianism was Robert Adam 172892 whose surviving work in London includes Kenwood House 1779 on Hampstead Heath and some of the interiors of Apsley House 1778 in Hyde Park Corner Adams fame has been eclipsed by that of John Nash 17521835 whose contribution to Londons architecture can almost compare to that of Christopher Wren Nash was responsible for the layout of Regents Park and its surrounding crescents To give London a spine he created Regent St as an axis from the new Regents Park south to St Jamess Park This project also involved the formation of Trafalgar Sq and the developmentA lovely row of four houses at 5255 Newington Green N16 make up Londons oldest surviving brick terrace houses Predating the Great

The Strand Nash refashioned the old Buckingham House into Buckingham Palace 1830 for George IV Nashs contemporary John Soane 17531837 was the architect of the Bank of England completed in 1833 though much of his work was lost during the banks rebuilding by Herbert Baker during 192539 as well as the Dulwich Picture Gallery 1814 Robert Smirke 17801867 designed the British Museum in 1823 its one of the finest expressions of the socalled Greek Revivalist style A Gothick Rethink In the 19th century the highly decorative neoGothic style also known as Victorian High Gothic or Gothick became all the vogue Champions were the architects George Gilbert Scott 181178 Alfred Waterhouse 18301905 and Augustus Pugin 181252 Scott was responsible for the elaborate Albert Memorial 1872 in Kensington Gardens and the 1872 Midland Grand Hotel later St Pancras Chambers and now once again a hotel Waterhouse designed the flamboyant Natural History Museum 1881 while Pugin worked from 1840 with the designer Charles Barry 17951860 on the Houses of Parliament after the Palace of Westminster burned down in 1834 The last great neoGothic public building to go up in London was the Royal Courts of Justice 1882 designed by George Edmund Street The emphasis on the artisanship and materials necessary to create these elaborate neoGothic buildings led to the socalled Arts and Crafts movement of which William Morris 183496 was the leading exponent Morris work can be seen in the Green Dining Room of the Victoria  Albert Museum and his Red House in Bexleyheath Flirting with Modernism Relatively few notable public buildings emerged from the first 15 years of the 20th century apart from Admiralty Arch 1910 in the Edwardian baroque style of Aston Webb 18491930 who also designed the 1911 Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace County Hall designed by Ralph Knott in 1909 was not completed until 1922 More modern imagination is evident in commercial design for example the superb artnouveau design of Michelin House on Fulham Rd dating from 1911 In the period between the two World Wars English architecture was barely more creative though Edwin Lutyens 18691944 designed the Cenotaph 1920 in Whitehall as well as the impressive 1927 Britannic House now with modern additions and called Alphabeta in Moorgate Displaying the same amount of Edwardian optimism is the former Port of London Authority 1922 designed by Edwin Cooper and now an apartment block and hotel Designed by US architect Harvey Wiley Corbett 18731954 Bush House at the southern end of Kingsway and until recently the home of the BBC World Service was built between 1923 and 1935 The delicious curves of the Daily Express Building 1932 Ellis Clarke with Owen Williams at 120 Fleet St are a splendid

seems to have a good word to say about the neighbouring National Theatre a brutalist structure by Denys Lasdun 19142001 begun in 1966 and finished a decade later The 1960s saw the ascendancy of the workaday glassandconcrete highrises exemplified by the mostly unloved Centre Point 1967 by Richard Seifert 19102001 But the oncevilified modernist tower has now been listed by English Heritage meaning that it cannot be altered for the most part The 1964 BT Tower formerly known as the Post Office Tower and designed by Eric Bedford 19092001 has also received listed status Little building was undertaken in the 1970s apart from roads and the recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s brought much development and speculation to a standstill Helping to polarise traditionalists and modernists still further was Prince Charles who described a proposed and never built extension to the National Gallery as being like a monstrous carbuncle on the face of an elegant and much loved friend

in London All you need to do when entering a station is touch your card on a reader which has a yellow circle with the image of an Oyster Card on them and then touch again on your way out The system will then deduct the appropriate amount of credit from your card as necessary For bus journeys you only need to touch once upon boarding The benefit lies in the fact that fares for Oyster Card users are lower than standard ones If you are making many journeys during the day you will never pay more than the appropriate Travelcard peak or off peak once the daily price cap has been reached Oyster Cards can be bought 5 refundable deposit required and topped up at any Underground station travel information centre or shop displaying the Oyster logo To get your deposit back along with any remaining credit simply return your Oyster Card at a ticket booth Contactless cards which do not require chip and pin or a signature can now be used directly on Oyster Card readers and are subject to

ATMs are everywhere and will generally accept Visa MasterCard Cirrus or Maestro cards as well as more obscure ones There is almost always a transaction surcharge for cash withdrawals with foreign cards There are nonbankrun ATMs that charge 150 to 2 per transaction These are normally found inside shops and are particularly expensive for foreignbank cardholders The ATM generally warns you before you take money out that it will charge you but be vigilant Also always beware of suspiciouslooking devices attached to ATMs Many London ATMs have now been made tamperproof but certain fraudsters devices are capable of sucking your card into the machine allowing the fraudsters to release it when you have given up and leftChanging Money The best place to change money is in any local post office branch where no commission is charged You can also change money in most highstreet banks and some travel agencies as well as at the numerous bureaux de change throughout the city Compare rates and watch for the commission that is not always mentioned very prominently The trick is to ask how many pounds youll receive in total before committing  youll lose nothing by shopping around Credit  Debit Cards Londoners live off their debit cards which can also be used to get cash back from supermarkets Card transactions and cash withdrawals are generally subject to additional charges for foreign cardholders check with your provider  Credit and debit cards are accepted almost universally in London from restaurants and bars to shops and even by some taxis  American Express and Diners Club are
