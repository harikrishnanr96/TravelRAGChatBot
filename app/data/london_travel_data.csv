Understand,History,settlements have existed on the site of london since well before roman times with evidence of bronze age and celtic inhabitants the roman city oflondinium established just after the roman conquest of britannia in the year 43 formed the basis for the modern city some isolated roman period remains are still to be seen within the city after the end of roman rule in 410 and a shortlived decline london experienced a gradual revival under the anglosaxons as well as the norsemen and emerged as a great medieval trading city eventually replacingwinchesteras the royal capital of england this paramount status for london was confirmed when william the conqueror a norman built thetower of londonafter the conquest in 1066 and was crowned king of england inwestminster london went from strength to strength with the rise of england to first european then global prominence and the city became a great centre of culture government and industry londons long association with the theatre for example can be traced back to the english renaissance witness therose theatredead linkand great playwrights likeshakespearewho made london their home with the rise of britain to supreme maritime power in the 18th and 19th centuries seeindustrial britain and the possessor of the largest global empire london became an imperial capital and drew people and influences from around the world to become for many years the largest city in the world englands royal family has over the centuries added much to the london scene for todays traveller thealbert memorialbuckingham palacekensington palaceroyal albert halltower of londonkew palaceandwestminster abbeybeing prominent examples despite the decline of the british empire and suffering during thesecond world warwhen london was heavily bombed by the german luftwaffe in the blitz the city remains a toptier world city a global centre of culture finance and learning today london is easily the largest city in the united kingdom eight times larger than the second largestbirmingham and ten times larger than the thirdglasgow and dominates the economic political and social life of the nation its full of excellent bars galleries museums parks and theatres it is also the most culturally and ethnically diverse part of the country and arguably of the whole of europe as well making it a great multicultural city to visit samuel johnson famously said when a man is tired of london he is tired of life whether you are interested in ancient history modern art opera or underground raves london has it all
Understand,The City and Westminster,historically london was two cities a commercial city and a separate government capital the commercial capital was thecity of london this had a dense population and all the other prerequisites of a medieval city walls a castle the tower of london a cathedral st pauls a semiindependent city government a port and a bridge across which all trade was routed so londoners could make money london bridge about an hour upstream on foot or by boat around a bend in the river was the government capital westminster this had a church for crowning the monarch westminster abbey and palaces as each palace was replaced by a larger one the previous one was used for government first the palace of westminster better known as the houses of parliament then whitehall then buckingham palace the two were linked by a road called the strand the old english word for riverbank london grew both west and east the land to the west of the city part of the parish of westminster was prime farming land covent gardenandsohofor example and made good building land the land to the east was flat marshy and cheap good for cheap housing and industry and later for docks also the wind blows 3 days out of 4 from west to east and the thames into which the sewage went flows from west to east so thewest endwas upwind and upmarket theeast endwas where people worked for a living modernday london in these terms is a twocentre city with the area in between known confusingly as the west end
Understand,Climate,despite having perhaps a fair reputation for being unsettled london enjoys a mildclimateon average as much as one in three days on average will bring rain though sometimes for only a short period in some years 2012 and 2018 being examples there was no rain for a number of weeks the fact that londoners would find this remarkable should be an indication to visitors from drier climates of what they may be in for extreme weatheris rare occasionally there may be heavy rain that can bring localised flooding or strong winds that may down trees and damage roofs but overall you are unlikely to encounter anything too lively winterin london is mild compared to nearby continental european cities due to both the presence of the gulf stream and the urban heat effect the average daily maximum temperature is 8 °c 46 °f in december and january the coldest temperature recorded in london stands at −161 °c 30 °f and was recorded at northolt during january 1962 but this occurred during one of the coldest winters ever experienced in the uk daylight hours are very short especially around winter with darkness falling at 345pm in the afternoon in december sunrise is not until after 8am in the morning around new years snowdoes occur usually a few times a year but rarely heavily a few years being exceptions such as the winters of 2009 and 2010 with temperatures dipping down to subzeros regularly snow in london can be crippling as seen at the end of 2010 just 7 centimetres 2 ¾ inches of snow will cause trains to stop running airports to see significant delays and the postal service to come to a halt london is a city which does not cope well with snow walkways stairs and streets will not be cleared by shovels or ploughs the streets will be saltedgritted but will remain slick and snowslush covered until the sun melts it away this is due to a lack of widespread snowclearing infrastructure as the city does not often see snow spring in the capital can be something of a weather rollercoaster with big variations in temperature day by day it can be a very wet time of year but the increases in day length from march onwards and steady temperature increases as the season progresses can make it a pleasant time to visit days can be mild and warm but the temperature will often dip at night as the suns warmth dissipates the beginning of spring in march can be as cold as winter so be sure to bring something warm to wear summer is perhaps the best season for tourists as it has long daylight hours as well as mild to warm temperatures the average daily high temperatures in july and august are around 24 °c 75 °f the highest temperature ever seen in london stands at 402 °c 1044 °f which was recorded at heathrow on 19 july 2022 daylight hours run from 445am to 915pm but begin to shorten as the summer wears on humidity across the city can increase and stay high over the course of several days and nights leading to muggy conditions also upon occasion clouds of dust from storms in the sahara desert can be blown across europe and lead to increases in pollution levels despite the increased warmth the weather in summer can be variable occasional prolonged instances of rain and unexpected dips in temperature can occur if youre coming during the summer it is still advised to dress in layers and bring some waterproofs autumn in london can vary from year to year in some years september and october can see temperatures similar to those seen in summer due to a phenomenon known as an indian summer but in other years the temperature can decrease rapidly to winter levels and stay there autumn tends to be the wettest and windiest season but again this can vary from year to year day length at the beginning of autumn is near that of summer meaning that a september trip can still be as easy to plan as an august one as theres plenty of daylight to work with midautumn is a wonderful time to wander one of londons many treefilled parks as the leaves fade from green to gold another benefit of a september trip is that children return to school at the beginning of the month meaning that some tourist attractions are quieter
Understand,Tourist information,there is no office for tourist information for the uk or for england however as of 2022 transport for london maintains four small visitor centres at certain arrival points see tfl website which offer advice on key attractions how to travel on the tfl network buying tickets etc
Talk,,as one would expect of the capital of england english is the main language spoken in london accents however do vary fromreceived pronunciationrp also known as thekingsqueens english that is spoken by the upperclass residents of westminster to the distinctivecockneyaccent spoken by the workingclass residents of the east end however rp has largely died out and has been supplanted bystandard southern english a more modern more middle class accent that pervades the south of the uk similarly cockney has been driven out of london now spoken mostly in essex as london is one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world that is home to immigrants from all over the formerbritish empire a new accent known asmulticultural london englishmle has developed among younger londoners who grew up with this cultural diversity mle has a cockney base but also incorporates noticeable influences from south asia africa and the caribbean and is often regarded as the most representative accent of modern british society many languages from all around the world are spoken by first generation immigrants in london for instancemandarinandcantoneseare commonly spoken in chinatown and other neighbourhoods with large numbers of ethnic chinese residents and numerous south asian languages such ashindiurdupunjabiandbengaliare spoken among the various south asian communities

Get in,By train,london is the hub of the british rail network  every major city in mainland britain has a frequent train service to the capital and most of the smaller provincial cities and large towns also have a direct rail connection to london of some sort  although the frequency and quality of service can vary considerably from place to place rail fares to london vary enormously from very cheap to prohibitively expensive  the golden rules are to book advance tickets for a particular train time dont travel into the city on friday afternoons and sundays and avoid leaving buying tickets until the day of travel there are three basic types of ticket which are summarised below much of the advice applies to rail travel in general within the united kingdom the local and commuter rail companies within the london and home counties area also have a bewildering array of special fares which are all in essence variations of the offpeak ticket and are far too detailed to cover here  go directly to the website of the operator concerned for more information if you only intend to use trains within the greater london boundary then theoyster cardexplained below is by far the easiest and cheapest option to use seats can be reserved for free on all longdistance trains to london  the reservation is always issued automatically with an advance ticket and with most offpeak and anytime tickets bought online if for whatever reason you hold an anytime or offpeak ticket and there is no seat reservation coupon then it is highly recommended you get one from any railway station ticket office  if you want to avoid camping out in the vestibule for all or part of the journey first class is available on all long distance services to london the standard of service varies from operator to operator but in general you get a wider more comfortable seat free teacoffee for the duration of the journey and some sort of complimentary catering service it can be great value if you get an advance firstclass fare but it is extremely expensive otherwise and to be honest  not really worth it you can pay a weekend supplement generally £1520 to sit in the first class section of the train on saturdays and sundays  useful if the service you are on is hideously overcrowded  but you dont get the same catering service as during the week if you are the holder of abritraildead linkpass things are simpler  reservations are not required however if you wish to be guaranteed a seat rather than standing for a lengthy journey trains can be very busy especially at peak times then you can make a seat reservation at any station if you intend to use the overnight sleeper trains to london you will have to pay a berth supplement for every member of your party  provided there is berth availability on the train london st pancras international station receives highspeed trains operated byeurostar from five cities in belgium france and the netherlandsamsterdam3 hr 55 minbrussels1 hr 50 minlille1 hr 22 minparis2 hr 15 min androtterdam3 hr 16 min it dives under the sea for 35 km 22 mi via the channel tunnel despite being considered a significant part of the route the train only passes through the channel tunnel for about half an hour and most of your journey will be spent above ground whizzing through the countryside there are airportstyle security checks prior to boarding although theyre not as strict leave ample time before your train departs for your belongings and yourself to be scanned and for your passport to be checked eurostar advises its customers to be at the security check at least 2 hours when departing france  belgium  the netherlands or 90 minutes when departing london ahead of departure for standard class due to extra border controls caused by brexit there is no advantage to arriving significantly earlier than this the segregated areas of each station have limited seating and the secure lobbies are not large so passengers are not usually allowed even to join the queue for the passport and security check until 2 hr90 min before their scheduled departure consider arriving at the train station just slightly earlier than the advised time so you can take 15 minutes to buy food bottles of water or lastminute gifts and still be in the queue at least a full hour before your train departs and before they start allowing the next train to join the queues the selection is wider and the prices are noticeably better in the regular stations than in the secure areas or on board the train like all train services various fares are available depending on the time of day and how far you book in advance there are three classes of ticket available business premier the most expensive standard premier and standard seats are available both with tables and without tables are popular with families and groups so if you require a table you will need to book far in advance the covid19 pandemic triggered the cancellation of eurostar services from disneyland alpine ski resorts and regional french cities as of 2023 these have not been reinstated however the continental cities still served by eurostar all have great rail access from elsewhere and there are through tickets available even for places not served by eurostar for exampledeutsche bahnoffers tickets from any station in germany to london for domestic train services there are 12 main linenational

and rail services map oyster isnotvalid on buses or trains outside london if you need to travel beyond the stations on the map you will have to pay for a paper ticket oyster is also not accepted on longdistance coaches tour buses or charter buses also oystercannotbe used on the heathrow express the following table summarises the validity of the different tickets you can use on oyster for most tourists the tube trains and buses are the only transport you will use but oyster is not valid at all on airport express trains to heathrow gatwick luton stansted or southend however oysterisvalid on the piccadilly underground line  the elizabeth line to heathrow airport note peak fares are charged at all times to heathrow airport when using your oyster card to travel make sure the reader is displaying an orange light then place it flat against the reader a single beep and a green light mean your card has been accepted and you can proceed two beeps and a red light mean your card has not been accepted take the card off the reader wait for the orange light and try again if this continues to happen ask for help from a member of staff dont try to insert your oyster card into the slot at the ticket gates when getting onany kind of train you must touch your oyster card on the yellow circular readerat the start and end of your journey at stations with ticket gates these readers will be on the righthand side of the gates in the outlying parts of the city there are no entry or exit gates at some stations in this case the readers are on freestanding cabinets next to entrancesexits failing to touch out when you leave a station will result in you being charged amaximum farefor your journey since the system doesnt know which station you left from the maximum fare is between £540 and £1420 and depends on the station where you started your journey usually you will not need to touch your oyster card on a reader whenchanging trains however some stations havepink oysterroute validators on the platforms if you are getting off one train and getting onto another at one of these stations touch your oyster on the pink reader so that the system charges you the right fare for the route you have taken there are a few other situations where you might have to touch out when changing trains usually when changing between tube dlr andor national rail  in these cases make sure youtouch back inbefore getting on your next train when using a londonbus or a tram touch inoncewhen getting ondonttouch out when you get off the bus or you will be charged twice most buses have their oyster reader next to the driver trams and some buses have oyster readers on poles next to the doors you can make achange to another bus or a tramfree of chargeduring one hour youll still have to touch your oyster on the 2nd bus or tram but no money will be deducted then contactless credit or debit cards or other rfid identitycards may interfere with your oysterif you keep them in the same wallet this usually results in an error message but may mean you get charged the full fare from your contactless credit or debit card instead be careful standing near the readers on some buses  they are often quite sensitive and may read your card from several centimetres away even if you did not intend this it is best to remove the card from the wallet or purse it is in you can top up your oyster card with cash at any tube station ticket machine or ticket office you can use a credit card if it has a pin with oyster payasyougo also known as prepay money is then deducted from your oyster card each time you travel when travelling by train the fare is calculated based on where you started and ended your journey payasyougo is much cheaper than paying by cash for each journey especially if you make multiple trips bus fares are flat and you will be charged the same fare every time you get on the bus regardless of distance the amount of oyster credit deducted from your card in one day is capped to a daily limit this means that on a daytoday basis you will always get the best fares when using oyster payasyougo even if you travel by bus only your total fares are also capped this makes bus travel very good value in central london if you are making lots of journeys atravelcardgives you unlimited travel on trains within the relevant zones and on red london buses a travelcard is typically loaded onto your oyster but for periods longer than 7 days you will usually need to register your oyster card or provide some form of photographic id for an uptodate and comprehensive list of fares seetfls website if you are using oyster and travel beyond the zones of your travelcard you will be charged an extension fare from your payasyougo credit when you touch out at your destination contactless creditdebit cards apple pay and google pay can be used topay faresanywhere oyster is accepted most visa mastercard maestro cirrus or american express cards issued outside the uk are accepted some prepaid cards may work as well some cards such as visa contactless cards issued in the united states will not work when you enter or leave a station or get on the bustouch the card against the yellow validation reader as if it were an oyster card the price is the same as with an oyster card the price per day is automatically capped at the price of a day ticket you also avoid the queues at ticket machines the £5 deposit for an oyster card and you never have to top it up a travelcard can not be loaded onto a contactless card the same card cannot be used by two or more different passengersyou must use the same device to touch in and out otherwise you may get charged for two journeys  for example if you touch in using your smartphone but touch out using your physical card the system may get confused and charge you twice even if the phone is linked to the same card you may notice a charge of £010 on your bank statement shortly after you touch in for the first time  this is normal this will change to the price of all your travel for that day usually overnight but sometimes it can take a few days using a contactless card as a visitor from abroad may be tricky though your bank may ask for additional confirmations so tfl may suspend accepting a card until you release a pending payment also sometimes you may end up with an unfinished journey even though youve touched an exit gate probably because a card may require a bit longer to process after a gate is opened keep your card at a reader until the gate opens fully you can sign up for acontactless and oyster accountto check for these issues every station where you can use oyster or contactless payment is in a fare zone from 1 to 9  you can see what zone a station is in on the tube map look for the shaded areas and numbers in the background some stations on the boundary of two zones have their name written in a white box which means theyre considered to be in both zones for example earls court is in zones 1 and 2 if your journey starts or ends at one of these stations the system will work out which zone would result in the cheapest fare and charge that the price of a journey is determined by how many zones it passes through in general the more zones you travel through the higher the fare with journeys passing through zone 1 most stations in central london being more expensive than ones going around it tfls website has asingle fare findertool that can be used to work out the price of a journey between any two stations most journeys have both apeak and offpeakfare  a peak journey is one starting between 0630 and 0930 and between 1600 and 1900 on working days excluding public holidays pay as you go fares arecapped once the fares for all your journeys on the same day add up to a certain amount which varies depending on all the zones travelled any further travel that day will be free there are also weekly caps covering all travel within a calendar week caps are calculated separately for peak and offpeak travel note that even once you have reached a daily or weekly capyou still need to touch in and outfor each journey otherwise you are traveling without a valid ticket  though you wont be charged anything for it if you use a combination of tube zone 16 railway and bus journeys the tubes fare caps based on the farthest zone you travelled to will apply to all your journeys for that day its still possible to pay for a journey by apaper single or return ticket however this only makes sense if you take perhaps two to three journeys on public transport during your trip to london as they cost significantly more roughly double the cost in comparison with the other means of payment season tickets can also be purchased in paper
Get around,Accessibility,if you have a physical disability you might find it harder to travel around london the oldest parts of the underground date from the middle of the 19th century and some of the surface rail network is even older therefore much of the transport system wasnt built to cater for people with disabilities narrow winding passageways steep staircases and cavernous gaps between some platforms and trains are all barriers for certain passengers however times and attitudes have changed all stations lines and trains built since the 1990s are accessible and many older stations have been retrofitted with lifts and ramps in addition all london buses and trams have lowfloor doors access ramps and space onboard for at least one wheelchair user most black cabs taxis are also accessible that said there are still significant gaps in accessibility particularly on the tube in central london to help you navigate tfl publish several maps to cater for different needs for more info visit thetransport accessibility portalon the tfl website
Get around,By Underground,thelondon underground known popularly asthe tubedue to its tubelike tunnels drilled through the london clay is a network of 11 lines which crisscross london in one of the largest underground rail networks in the world it was also the first the oldest section from paddington to farringdon opened as the metropolitan railway in 1863 the tube is an easy method of transport even for new visitors to london and is equivalent to subway and metro systems in other world cities the routes operated by the london underground fall into 2 broad types the older subsurface lines encompassing the metropolitan district circle and hammersmith  city lines date from the 19th century the deep level routes were largely constructed in the earlytomid20th century the subsurface lines are usually accessed by walking down a short set of stairs whereas the deeplevel lines are accessed by a complicated network of escalators or lifts it is the deep lines which are served by the iconic tubeshaped trains which despite their small size can only just fit through the tunnels however the deeplevel trains do not have air conditioning which can make them unbearably hot in the summer each line has stations with interesting architectural and artistic features typical of the era they were opened as you travel around the network look out for victorian finery edwardian glazed tiles smooth art deco symmetry and striking modern masterpieces various conservation pieces are also present such as the heritage 1900s station name roundel sign at caledonian road on the westbound platform trains on most days and on most lines run from around 530am to around 1am they are usually the fastest way to travel in london the only problem being the relative expense and the fact that they can get extremely crowded during rush hours 73010am and 4307pm there is no air conditioning on the deeplevel trainstfls websitehas a page notifying of tracking delays closures and planned engineering works which you should check if you plan to travel on a saturday or a sunday when entire lines may be shut down due to engineering works if youre travelling around central london then taking the tube for just one stop can be a waste of time for example to travel between leicester square and covent garden stations takes over 10 minutes on the tube despite the two stations being only a few minutes walk apart this is especially true since the walk from a tube station entrance to the platform at some central stations can be extensive the tube map also gives no information on londons extensive bus network or any of its national rail network except for thameslink for more information see theby foot section thenight tube introduced in 2016 is a limited 24hour tube service that operates on certain lines on fridays and saturdays night tube fares are the same as the offpeak fares during the day day travelcards are valid on the day they were issued using the date printed on the card and for journeys starting before 430am the following day for example if you buy a day travelcard at 11am on friday you can use it until 429am on the following saturday daily capping on oyster cards and contactless payment cards also applies as of april 2022 the night tube runs on the following lines itusedto run on some other lines but this has been curtailed due to the coronavirus also note that until june 2022 there are strikes that can affect the night tube service for the central and victoria lines which the former likely to be more severe travel on the tube system will always require the purchase of a ticket or the use of an oyster card or contactless payment card if you have one fare evasion is treated as a serious matter and will get you a fine single tickets are charged at two rates depending on the payment method cash fares and single oyster fares are zonal meaning that the price of a journey is determined by the zones you travelled through there are additional fares payable for zones beyond 9 but these are mostly outside what is considered london paper travelcards valid for 1 day or 7 days are also available and can also be used on buses national rail trains the dlr and croydon tramlink  however there is a capping feature for contactless and oyster cards which guarantees a strict upper bound on the fare you pay for a day and a week which means that a paper travelcard is unnecessary and costlier almost all stations have automatic ticket barriers if you pay by oyster card or a contactless payment card just tap your card against the yellow pad to open the barriers ensure that you do this upon both entrance and exit if you have a paper ticket insert it faceup into the slot on the front of the machine and remove it from the top to enter the station if you have a single ticket it will be retained at the exit gate if you have luggage or if your ticket is rejected there is normally a staffed gate as well paper tickets can be purchased from vending machines in the stations ticket hall the touchscreen machines have instructions in multiple languages offer a greater choice of ticket and accept bills and creditdebit cards if your card has no embedded microchip you cannot use these machines these machines do not support contactless you can also add oyster payasyougo credit on many mainline ticket vending machines in london if you have a national train ticket which involves travelling across london egbrightontodarlington you may be able to travel on the tube across london from one london terminus to another if your train ticket has any permitted † with the dagger symbol written in the route section at the bottom of the ticket then you are able to travel on the tube without buying another ticket these can be used at the ticket barriers in the same way as the paper tickets described above all lines are identified by name eg circle line central line piccadilly line many lines have multiple branches rather than running pointtopoint so always check the trains destination which is shown on the front of the train and the platform indicator screens and will be broadcast on the trains pa most branches are only served by specific services from the eastern end of the district line at upminster for instance you can only catch trains for ealing broadway and richmond  if you want to go to wimbledon you will have to change trains later down the line trains stop at all stations with the exception of the metropolitan line which during peak hours runs semifast and fast trains that skip some stations signs can be seen to be vague especially if you are unfamiliar with what compass point direction eg northbound youre travelling in as these are most often given rather than destinations a person new to the tube can become very frustrated trying to work out where a particular connection at a particular station is found each station is staffed by at least two personnel at all times who can advise you on your route and full system maps are on the walls of every platform and ticket office additionally on every platform there are individual line maps showing all the stations served by trains calling at that platform google maps is another handy tool the tube is made up of 11 lines each bearing a traditional name and a standard colour on the tube map you can change between lines at interchange stations providing you stay within the zones shown on your ticket since the tube map is well designed it is very easy to work out how to get between any two stations and since each station is clearly signed it is easy to work out when to exit your train the tube map is a diagram and not a scaled map making it misleading for determining the relative distance between stations as it makes central stations appear further apart and somewhat out of place  the most distant reaches of the metropolitan line for example are almost 64 km 40 mi from the centre of the city tube maps are freely available from any station most tourist offices and are prominently displayed in stations thenational rail mapshowing national rail services is displayed as a large poster at most tube stations direction signs for the platforms indicate the geographical direction of the linenotthe last stop of the line it is always advisable to carry a pocket tube map to help you with this thenorthern linehas two routes through central london which split at euston and rejoin at kennington one the charing cross branch runs through the west end while the other route runs via the city of london called the bank branch or the city branch it is fairly easy to work out which way your train is going check the signs above the platform and on the front of the train the trains destination and central branch will also be announced on board for example this train is for edgware via charing cross the london underground has connections to all terminals at heathrow including terminals 4  5 and most major london rail termini with the exception of fenchurch street interchange hubs are also served such as farringdon elephant  castle harrow  wealdstone and stratford be considerate of your fellow passengers as best you can pushing and rushing are seen as extremely rude  theres not much need to run for a tube train unless its the very last one of the day also trying to strike up a conversation with strangers is seen as peculiar and will instantly mark you out as a tourist despite having a reputation as being aloof londoners are usually happy to help out if you have a problem but otherwise theyd rather you didnt try to be overly familiar in some cases particularly for the subsurface lines the tube doors have buttons on the outside they normally come to use if a train is waiting for over 45 seconds as the doors will automatically close to conserve energyifthe train isnt ready to depart which is easy to check  if the button isnt illuminated the train is ready to depart pressing the button will open the doors when using the escalatorsalways stand on the rightto allow people in a hurry to pass drinking alcohol or smoking anywhere on the london underground is illegal crime levels on the tube are comparable to but typically lower than in many other subway systems and traveller advice about watching luggage and valuables is reasonable the tube system is covered by an extensive cctv system although it is not advised to be reliant on this fact when travelling the london underground considers its safety record to be a matter of professional honour major incidents being incredibly rare despite the media attention they generate frontline staff are well trained for emergencies and will follow wellrehearsed procedures in addition frontline staff are generally appreciative of traveller vigilance if concerns are politely expressed if you notice something that concerns you please speak to a member of staff or a british transport police officer on the wall of the platforms or freestanding on outdoor platforms there will be a round white device labelled help point with one or two buttons and a fire alarm press the green button to alert staff to an emergency and press the blue button to ask for nonurgent assistance if you see smoke or fire always use the fire alarm first on tube trains you will notice that there is a red handle you can pull to alert the driver to a serious incident or accident occurring on the train if the train is in a tunnel the alarm should only be used in dire emergencies that require immediate attention as pulling the alarm will activate the trains brakes in practice when the alarm is activated a driver will move the train forward into the next station where help can be obtained therefore the alarms should only be used in stations if possible as passengers will then be able to escape the train quickly if needed tfl advise travellers to carefully consider their usage of the passenger alarm and if suitable leave the train at the next station and seek help from station staff instead because trains on the london underground are run close together any delays can have serious knockon effects for the rest of the service in contrast train drivers vary in their opinion as to when the alarm should be used consensus tends to be that if its something you would run down the train to tell the driver then the alarm should definitely be used owing to a heightened security climate and a history of political violence targeting the tube unattended baggage may be treated as a suspect or explosive device and may be destroyed lost items if not destroyed will end up at thelost property officeand will be stored for 3 months you will need to fill in a form online describing your lost item and tfl will contact you if it is found there is a charge for recovery of most items however some items eg laptops have higher fees 
Get around,By bus,londons iconic redroutemasterbuses which are recognised the world over were withdrawn from regular service in 2005 although a heritage service was continued on portions of two routes this ceased in 2019 routemasters are still used for tours and private parties buses are generally quicker than taking the tube for shorter less than a couple of stops on the tube trips and out of central london youre likely to be closer to a bus stop than a tube station most buses in london are very frequent at least every ten minutes and are accessible for buggies and wheelchairs buses also have a flat rate fare which stays the same no matter how far you travel you will need to pay the fare again if you board a different bus although the hopper fare allows you to take as many buses as you like in 62 minutes and only pay for the first one over 5 million bus trips are made each weekday with over 700 different bus routes you are never far from a bus each bus stop has a sign listing the routes that stop there and bus routes are identified by numbers and sometimes letters buses have very clearblindson the front with their route number and their destination transport for london

three doors as long as you touch in your oyster or contactless card as soon as you board it should be noted that unlike the tube you are allowed to use an oyster card which has zero but not negative

on the tube you are charged for each bus you travel on if you change buses then you will normally be charged a new bus fare up to the dailyweekly price cap however thehopper fareallows you to make unlimited bus or tram journeys for the price of one if you use an oyster card or contactless payment method all of your journeys must be made within an hour of touching in on the first bus or tram you are travelling on and you must also use the same oyster or contactless card for the other journeys if you have a sevenday monthly or yearly travelcard or bus and tram pass on your oyster that includes free bus travel across all of london even outside the zones of your travelcard buses arent subject to zones you still must touch in when you get on the bus but you wont be charged if you do not have a travelcard the fare is taken from your oyster pay as you go credit as soon as you touch in when you get on the bus daily bus and tram travel is capped so you generally wont pay more than an equivalent travelcard unlike the tube you are allowed to use an oyster card which has zero but not negative or insufficient balance  this will cause the balance to be negative the machines will flash an emergency fare charged message which is the same as the normal fare however you must then recharge before the card can be used again touch your oyster on the reader as soon as you get on the bus or you may be liable to a penalty fare or prosecution you can also pay for with most contactless debit credit or prepaid visa mastercardmaestro or american express cards you touch the card flat against the reader like you would with an oyster card but your account is charged instead some foreignissued cards will not work for contactless payment the total charges for that day are calculated and taken

standard bus services run from around 6am1230am around half past midnight the network changes to the vast night bus network of well over 100 routes stretching all over the city there are two types of night buses 24hour routes and nprefixed routes 24hour services keep the same number as during the day and will run exactly the same route such as the number 88 for example nprefixed routes are generally very similar to their dayroute but may take a slightly different route or are extended to serve areas that are further out for example the 29 bus goes from trafalgar square to wood green during the day however the n29 bus goes from trafalgar square to wood green and then continues to enfield night buses run at a 30minute frequency at minimum with many routes at much higher frequencies up to every 5 minutes prices stay the same and daily travelcards are valid until 0429 the day after they were issued so can be used on night buses most bus stops will have night bus maps with all the buses to and from that local area on it although it is good to check on the tfl website beforehand which also has all those maps easily available
Get around,By DLR,docklands light railway dlris a dedicated light rail network operating ineast london connecting with the tube network at bank tower gateway close to tower hill station canning town heron quays close to canary wharf tube station and stratford as the trains operate automatically it can be quite exciting – especially for children – to sit at the front and look out through the window whilst feeling as though one is driving the train oneself the dlr runs above ground on much of its route and travels through many scenic parts of london including the docklands area where most of londons skyscrapers are located the dlr can be a little confusing as the routes are not easily distinguished however there are network maps on the train and the platform check the displays on the platform which will show you the destination and the wait for the next three trains and also check the destination displays on the front and side of the train and listen for announcements at busy times some trains do not run the full length of the route in this instance you should take the first train listen for announcements and change where necessary be extra careful atcanning townstation as it is very busy and the line divides into two sections  one heading to woolwich arsenal and the other heading to beckton always check the destination on the front of the train before getting on especially at offpeak times when there may not be a return train for a good few minutes if you end up on the wrong branch unlike on the tube most dlr stations do not have ticket gates except for bank and stratford as they are unstaffed also unlike the tube youdoneed to push the buttons to open the doors you can top up an oyster card buy a travelcard or buy a paper ticket at a substantial premium from the ticket machines at the station most stations are unstaffed so if you want to pay by cash then make sure you have plenty of change as there are no gates when travelling by oyster you must always remember to touch in at the start of your journey and touch out at the end even if you are changing to the underground at canary wharfheron quays you must still touch inout at the dlr station the system will recognise that you have made an interchange between the two stations and treat it as part of the same journey
Get around,By train,the british railway system is known asnational railalthough some older signs still refer to it as british rail londons suburban rail services are operated by several private companies under tightlywritten government contracts and mostly run in the south of the city away from the main tourist sights only one line thameslink runs through central london  on a northsouth axis between london bridge or blackfriars stations and the underground level of st pancras main line station there is no one central station  instead there are twelve mainline stations dotted around the edge of the central area and most are connected by the circle line except euston fenchurch street and those south of the river like waterloo and london bridge most visitors will not need to use national rail services except for a few specific destinations such as wimbledon hampton court kew gardens kew bridge station windsor castle greenwich or the airports or indeed if they are intending to visit other destinations in the uk its important to know that the quickest route between two stations is often a combination of the tube as well as national rail trains for instance if you are going from central london to wimbledon it will usually be much quicker to go to waterloo and take the first wimbledon train around 15 minutes maximum rather than take the district line which can take up to 45 minutes your payasyougo oyster card is valid in london zones 19 and some extensions but not beyond so be careful — if you want to travel beyond the london zones you will need to buy a paper ticket from the ticket office at the station if you travel beyond the london zones with no valid ticket you will be charged a penalty fare on national rail services this is usually £20 you will have to buy another ticket for the remainder of your journey and you will also be charged the maximum oyster fare because you didnt touch out this adds up to a lot so be careful and make sure you plan your journey if in doubt ask at the ticket office importantly there are stations where contactless paymentbut notoyster is accepted  watch out for them there are express trains to and from heathrow gatwick and stansted airports tickets are often sold at a substantial premium so you may want to consider taking the slightly slower stopping services instead for instance an anytime single from victoria to gatwick costs more on the gatwick express then when marked route southern only—taking a southern train to gatwick is only eight minutes longer similarly while the journey from paddington station to heathrow airport by elizabeth line will take around 1015 minutes longer than by heathrow express the walkup fare will be twice as cheap and even cheaper on the tube though the journey takes considerably longer so its often only worth the premium when youre in a hurryoyster cards are only validto heathrow when travelling by tube heathrow express or the elizabeth line to gatwick by national rail including gatwick express and to city by dlr to all other airports they are not valid dont throw your ticket away until youre out of the station at your destination many stations have ticket gates which you will need to put your ticket through to exit also you need to retain all the parts of your ticket throughout your journey as a member of railway staff may need to see it
Get around,By Overground,overground hints in common parlance londoners may refer to travelling by overground meaning going by national rail as opposed to going by underground however onlylondon overgroundis a transport for london rail service which serves most boroughs of the capital oyster cards are accepted trains will usually run a minimum frequency of every 15 minutes and some stations have a considerably more frequent service the trains have big windows allowing for great urban scenic views the overground appears on the tube map as a double orange line tfl also produces amap only showing overground services at many stations trains leaving from the same platform will go to different destinations so listen carefully for announcements and always check the destination on the front of the train the overground can be a great way to avoid changing trains in central london by skirting around the centre its also wellconnected you can frequently change for underground trains other overground destinations or for mainline national rail services from stratford clapham junction and watford junction the different overground services will be given distinct line names and colours from autumn 2024 
Get around,By the Elizabeth line,theelizabeth lineknown as crossrail before and during construction is londons newest railway line having opened in may 2022 after a long series of delays it appears on the tube map as a double purple line the colour purple is associated with royalty it runs from reading and heathrow airport in the west toabbey woodandshenfieldin the east via london paddington farringdon london liverpool st and stratford the elizabeth line is comparable to the rer in paris compared to the underground it has longer and faster trains that stop less frequently with the exception of ilford station it is fully wheelchairaccessible and the trains are airconditioned
Get around,By Tramlink,the tramlink network which is operated aslondon trams is centred oncroydon where it runs on streetlevel tracks around the croydon loop providing transit to an area not wellserved by the tube or national rail route 3 wimbledon to new addington  green on the tramlink map is the most frequent service running every 7 or 8 minutes monday to saturday daytime and every 15 minutes at all other times beckenham is served by routes 1 and 2 yellow and red on the tramlink map which terminate at elmers end and beckenham junction respectively all services travel around the loop via west croydon and run every 10 minutes monday to saturday daytime and every 30 minutes at all other times between arena and sandilands these two services serve the same stops
Get around,On foot,london is a surprisingly compact city making it a walkers delight in many instances walking is the quickest method of transport between two points because britain drives on the left hand side of the road for most foreign visitors it can be all too easy to forget that traffic will come at you from the opposite direction than you are used to when crossing a street  for this reasonremember to look right when you cross the road if you are using a pedestrian crossing dont risk it even if you cant see any traffic coming wait for the green man to appear and then cross quickly and carefully some pedestrian crossings now have countdown timers to indicate how long it will be safe to cross for particularly on central londons busiest streets it is easy to spot native londoners as they weave in and out of the large crowds at fast speed tourists who cannot will stand out make sure youre aware of your surroundings when in london—londoners are usually very considerate but a group of tourists standing in the middle of the pavement can be a major annoyance try standing to the side of busy pavements and footpaths especially if youre with a group in some instances it can be faster to walk some or all of your intended route instead of taking the tube by looking at a map youll notice that some central london tube stations are a lot closer together than the tube map would make you believe tfl haveproduced a map detailing the walking time and number of steps between various popular stations here are some more specific instructions for some of the stations that you are likely to use as a tourist oxford circus station can become extremely busy on weekday evenings and if convenient it is worth walking to other tube stations
Get around,By bicycle,cycling in the united kingdom the rules for cyclists are available in the british government publicationthe highway code due to the expense of other forms of transport and the compactness of central londoncyclingis a tempting option free cycle maps can usually be obtained from your local tube station or bike shop most major roads in london will have a bus lane which is restricted to buses taxis and bicycles there are also many signposted cycle routes and cycle lanes but the kind of contiguous cycle lane network found in many other european cities does not exist the safest option is to stick to minor residential roads where traffic can be surprisingly calm outside rush hours critical mass london is a cycling advocacy group which meets for regular rides through central london at 6pm on the last friday of each month rides start from the southern end of waterloo bridge thelondon cycling campaignis an advocacy group for london cyclists with active local groups in most of the citys boroughs it is recognised by local and regional government as the leading voice for cycling in the capital normally a cyclist should keep to the left of the lane when cycling on a road with traffic to allow fastermoving traffic to overtake however it is legal for a cycle to dominate a lane by maintaining a central road position like any other vehicle this will make you unpopular with any traffic behind you but it is recommended in london on approach to righthand turns at junctions making a righthand turn from the normal leftposition means crossing the lane of traffic which may often ignore you and any turn signals you might have been using leading to potential accidents permission to take bikes on trains is very limited in london due to overcrowding nonfolding bikes can be taken only on limited sections of the tube network mostly only on the aboveground sections outside peak hours for this reason folding bicycles are becoming increasingly popular mostnational railoperators allow bicycles outside peak hours london offers a bicycle hire scheme known assantander cycles operated by transport for london they are colloquially referred to as boris bikes after boris johnson as they were introduced during his period as mayor of london docking stations can be found across central london and slightly further out into areas such as brixton the docklands hammersmith and the queen elizabeth olympic park the bikes all coloured a distinctive red can be unlocked at any hire dock and then ridden to wherever you want after each journey the bike must be returned to a docking station on the network by locking the bike into the rack and receiving confirmation via a green light you pay via a credit or debit card and two payment plans exist daily and yearly a £2 daily plan as of october 2020 gives access to the system for an unlimited number of rides for 24 hours a fee for the first 30 minutes of each ride is included in the initial payment for every other 30 minutes above that it costs extra £2 a yearly plan costs £90 for a full year thesantander cycles appshows where bikes are available and can be used to make the hiring process faster although sometimes the app doesnt show a journey as finished even if the bike was successfully docked back at a station if in doubt its better to check your activity log on the official site the santander bikes main competitor islime whose fleet of electric bikes can be parked almost anywhere in much of inner london not just at docking stations download the app and set up a payment method first then use your phone to scan a bike and unlock it rides are £1 plus £015 per minute february 2021 cycle lanesprovide onroad and off road routes the network is not comprehensive and on the road lanes vary in quality and size normally 12 m wide some are indicated just with a stencilled image of a bike on the road if the line between the traffic lane and cycle lane is solid then vehicles may sometimes enter the space a dashed line indicates a recommended cycle lane and motorists may make use of this road space but its recommended that they dont londonscyclewaysconnect destinations across

Get around,By taxi,london has two types of taxis the famousblack cab and socalledminicabs black cabs are the only ones licensed to ply for hire ie pick people up off the street while minicabs are more accurately described as private hire vehicles and need to be prebooked the famousblack cabof london not always black can be hailed from the kerb or found at one of the many designated taxi ranks it is possible to book black cabs by phone for a fee but if you are in central london it will usually be quicker to hail one from the street their amber taxi light will be on if they are available drivers must pass a rigorous exam of central londons streets known as the knowledge to be licensed to drive a black cab this means they can supposedly navigate you to almost any london street without reference to a map they are a cheap transport option if there are five passengers as they do not charge extras and many view them as an essential experience for any visitor to london black cabs charge by distance and by the minute are nonsmoking and have a minimum charge of £300 as of 2019 tipping is not mandatory in either taxis or minicabs despite some drivers expectations  use your discretion if you like the service you may tip if the ride has been uncomfortable or unsafe or if the driver was rude dont most londoners will simply round up to the nearest pound taxis are required by law to take you wherever you choose within greater london if their taxi light is on when you hail them however some especially older drivers dislike leaving the centre of town or going south of the river thames a good way to combat being left at the side of the curb is to open the back door or even get into the cab before stating your destination minicabsare normal cars which are licensed hire vehicles that you need to book by phone or at a minicab office they generally charge a fixed fare for a journey best agreed before you get in the car minicabs are usually cheaper than black cabs although this is not necessarily the case for short journeys licensed minicabs display a transport for london tfl licence  usually in the front window one of the features of the license plate is a blue version of the famous london transport roundel a list of licensed minicab operators can be found attfl cabwise tfl operate a service calledcabwise which will determine your location and provide three local licensed cab numbers if you have an iphone or an android smartphone you can use the cabwise application search your platforms app store or textcabto 60835 be careful  this might not work from some phones you can also use an app such asmytaxidead link which allows you to summon a black cab to your location and will provide a map and approximate wait time for your taxi to arrive most railway stations will also be able to provide a list of good local cab firms many will display this outside the station even after the last train of the night has gone some areas in london are poorly served by black cabs particularly late at night this has led to illegal minicabs operating who are just opportunistic people with a car looking to make some fast money some of these illegal operators can be fairly aggressive in their attempts to find customers and its now barely possible to walk late at night through any part of london with a modicum of nightlife without being approached if youve booked a licensed minicab to collect you from a venue the driver or operator should be able to give you additional details an example being the phonenumber you booked them from to confirm they are legitimate you shouldavoidminicabs touting for business off the street and either take a black cab book a licensed minicab by telephone or take a night bus not only is it illegal for unlicensed minicabs to ply for trade on the street these illegal cabs are also regularly unsafe with a risk of robbery or assault a possibility given that the operators of such illegal minicabs are in no way checked or vetted for past offences always rememberif its not licensed and its not prebooked its just a strangers car never get into an unbooked minicab uberis available in london and generally charge cheaper fares than black cabs although higher surge prices are charged at times of high demand vehicles can only be booked via the smartphone app
Get around,By car,londoners who drive will normally take public transport in the centre follow their example unless you have a disability there is no good reason whatsoever to drive a car in central london driving in central london is a slow frustrating expensive and often unnecessary activity there are many sorts of automatic enforcement cameras and it is difficult and expensive to park driving outside of central london is easier but traffic can still be an issue and most tourists wont head out that far unless they have a reason for those with disabilities driving can be much more convenient than using public transport if disabled and a resident of a member state of the eu then two cars can be permanently registered for free for the congestion charge theres aspeed limitof 20 mph 32 kmh on most roads inside the central london congestion charge zone and several boroughs have boroughwide 20 limits limits elsewhere follow uk norms seedriving in the united kingdomspeed limitsfor details driving into central london on weekdays during daylight hours incurs a hefty charge called the congestion charge with very few exemptions rental cars also attract the charge cameras and mobile units record and identify the number plates and registration details of all vehicles entering the charging zone with high accuracy thecentral london congestion chargemf 7am6pm excluding public holidays attracts a fee of £15 numerous payment options exist by phone online at convenience stores displaying the red c logo in the window and by voucher failure to pay the charge by midnight the next charging day incurs a hefty automatic fine of £160 £80 if paid within 2 weeks there are additional charges and penalties for vehicles not meeting certain emissions standards despite the congestion charge london  like most major cities  continues to experience traffic snarls these are of course worse on weekdays during peak commuting hours ie 30930am and 47pm at these times public transport and especially the tube usually offers the best alternative for speed and reduced hassle one good tip is that outside advertised restricted hours usually on a sunday parking on asingleyellow line is permissible parking on a red line or adoubleyellow line is never permissible and heavily enforced find and read the parking restrictions carefully parking during weekdays and on saturday can also mean considerable expense in parking fees fees and restrictions are ignored at your extreme financial peril issuing fines clamping andor towing vehicles without warning has become a veritable new industry for borough councils staffed by armies of traffic wardens also watch out for marked parking bays as thesealwayshave restrictions many are resident parking only between certain hours and you will be fined if you park during these hours without a permit some bays also have restrictions on how long you can park in them for and these can be confusing if in doubt dont park if you are driving to your destination then its safest to find a dedicated private car park nearby these may be eyewateringly expensive but parking on the roads is a lottery with low odds of you winning two large car park operators arencpandqpark motorcycles and scooters are fairly common in london as they can pass stationary cars can usually be parked for free and are exempt from the congestion charge scooters and bikes with automatic transmission are much more preferable  a manuallygeared racing bike is completely impractical unless you have excellent clutch control although it has to be said you will see plenty of them being ridden aggressively by motorcycle couriers and locals as it can be the fastest way to get around likewise to bicycles car drivers can sometimes show disregard to anyone on two wheels and larger vehicles have an unwritten priority so take care when crossing junctions helmets are mandatory parking for bikes is usually free  there are designated motorcycleparking areas on some sidestreets and some multilevel car parks will have bike parking on the ground level

Sleep,Hotels,your budget will have a lot to do with what part of london you will want to stay in touriststandard prices range from £20200 per person per night expect smaller than average rooms especially at the low end of this range as a general rule expect to pay between £75 and £150 per night for a two or threestar hotel in the central area of the city many of the big name chain hotels now offer substantial discounts with rates often down as low as £30£50 per room per night if you book well in advance but the drawback is that you have to pay the full amount upfront at the time of booking and there are no refunds if you cancel the heart of the west end is the most expensive place to stay and most hotels are either four or fivestar and most will command a hefty price premium the cityandcanary wharfcan also be very expensive during the week as they rely heavily on the captive business market but prices often drop dramatically over the weekend when the business travel dries up booking there can be a good way of getting into a higher standard of accommodation than you could otherwise afford however much of the city becomes a ghost town over the weekend and you will find that few bars and restaurants are open away from the main tourist attractions be exceptionally careful regarding the big budget hotel chains such as premier inn and travelodge prices for their london hotels in contrast to elsewhere can often meet or exceed those of other better quality hotels so it cannot just be assumed that you will get a good deal from them some of travelodges city of london hotels especially are ofshockinglypoor quality for the prices they charge a top tip however is to always check the likes of londontowncom expedia and laterooms as well as the hotels own website since there are often deals to be had which can reduce the costs significantly the extra cost of getting around is probably not significant compared to savings made by staying in a hotel further out near an underground or railway station always be sure though to check where the closest tube station is to your hotel staying further out will be cheaper but when travelling in allow 12 min per tube stop near the centre around 23 min per stop further out and 510 min per line changes this can easily total up to a 1 hour journey if there is a walk at each end there are many hotels close to transport hub stations such as stratford greenwich ealing broadway wimbledon and east croydon a more imaginative alternative could be to stay in a nearby town with quick and easy train travel to london for example livelybrightonotherwise known as london by sea is only an hour away but your budget will go much further and there are excellent accommodation options some of the better value options are to be found in the following central districts a slightly leftfield option is to check thelandmark trust a building preservation charity who purchase notable old buildings in the uk renovate and run them as holiday lettings an interesting approach to saving old buildings for sure

card detail to people on the street no matter how genuine they seem cash machineatm scams most usage of these machines is perfectly safe but there are various ways that thieves can either obtain your card or your cash when using an atm it is always safest to withdraw cash using a machine inside a bank but street machines are usually more convenient before inserting your card visually check the machine for anything that looks odd thieves sometimes install cameras above the pin pad if things look ok then reach out and wiggle the slot where you insert your card  if the slots loose dont put your card in as there may be a device installed to trap your card all good ok is there anyone standing too close to you or hovering nearby if so perhaps cancel the transaction and go elsewhere if everythings good then go ahead when obtaining your cash and retrieving your card hover your hand over the slot to be ready to grab them as soon as they come out is anyone trying to distract you dont let them and leave swiftly if you notice anything odd about a cash machine or people nearby then phone the police on 101 999 in an emergency or report it to the premises the machine is attached to dont try to remove any devices yourself cup and ball game this variant of a scam dating back into antiquity is perhaps the most common and is frequently seen on the busier pedestrian bridges such as westminster bridge a person will lay out a mat with three cups on it they will pretend to hide a ball under one of the cups move the cups around and then ask you to place a bet on where the ballcontaining cup has landed there is no ball  the con artist will have spirited it away this con always has people acting as lookouts in the crowd and they will pretend to win every now and again so it looks like the game is winnable also beware if you are just stopping to watch as you could be pickpocketed the best defence is to walk straight past these events and not engage at all if you have a mobile phonecellphone that works in the ukyou can phone the police on 101the nonemergency equivalent to 999 and report them but it is advised to move away to do this as you may be harassed by the con artist or their lookouts if they overhear you overzealous street performers most street performers are happy to just do their thing let you watch and then you can throw them a few coins if you liked the show however some street performers will actively grab and harass passersby in order to get attention and money they may forcefully pose with you and ask you to take a photograph and then demand money for the photo opportunity they may also take this opportunity while youre distracted to pickpocket you dont engage with any street performer who is pushy or forceful  try and walk away or call out get off me or no and draw attention to yourself if you cant escape easily again you can report these bogus street performers on the 101 number as above tissue sellers on trains beggars will get onto a train and place tissues on the seats with a note begging for money they want you to feel pity for them and buy the tissues but this is an organised scam and the money goes towards criminal

and recommend a local bar or even a club that has a show the establishment will be neardesolate and even if the victim has only a drink or two the bill will run to hundreds of pounds if payment is not immediately provided the bouncers will lock the patrons inside and take it by force or take them to an atm and stand over them while they extract the cash to be safe if a woman you just met suggests you a place try to recommend a different bar if she insists on hers then walk away and do not listen to her suggestions sometimes this con trick takes place when someone is lured into a private club with the promise of something perhaps more than a drink like a private show or sex for a small amount of money a hostess fee will appear on the bill for several hundred pounds even though there has been nothing more than polite conversation stress tests if anyone offers you a free stress test they are likely trying to recruit you into the church of scientology the best option is to walk away or just say no thank you politely as people are commonly harassed into giving personal details needing money for phonetrain ticketsthe buset al someone will approach you asking for money for public transport they will claim that they have lost their travelcard or that it has been damaged somehow most people upon losing their travelcard will seek aid at a train station and not approach random strangers another variant of this scam exists wherein a man or woman will ask for change so they can make a call at a phone box occasionally a person with a very convincing fake injury will ask for money so that they can get a taxi to hospital strangely refusing the offer of you calling an ambulance or the police for them as you would do for most injured people in the street ignore them ticket
